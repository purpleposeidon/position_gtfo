This is a Firefox WebExtension for blocking model popups and dickbars.
It's basically a global ban on the `position: fixed` CSS rule,
along with other things.

Usage
=====
There's just a single emoji-button for controlling it. 

ðŸ‘Œ (`OK HAND SIGN`): Nothing blockable.

ðŸ’© (`PILE OF POO`): Blockable things are hidden. Press to view them.

ðŸ¤” (`THINKING FACE`): Blockable things are shown. Press to hide them.

Debugging
=========
1. Navigate to `about:debugging`
2. Optional: activate `Enable add-on debugging`
3. Click `Load Temporary Add-on`, and select the `manifest.json` file.
4. ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©ðŸ’©
